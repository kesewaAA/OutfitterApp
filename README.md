# OutfitterApp

This is a simple app that suggests clothing outfits based on user input

Create a "Today's Suggestion" screen for the app. The user is taken to this screen when they tap on the "See today's suggestion" button on the home screen of the app. The Suggestion screen has "Today's Suggestion" at the top in blue in the same location as the title on the home screen. Below that is a divider line in light blue. Below the divider line is the words "Based on: Casual, 55° F" where "55° F" is replaced by the current weather. Use the home screen for reference as to how to display the current weather on the suggestion screen. Below that is two item boxes. One has hoodie.jpg and the other has sweatpants.webp. Both these image files can be found in the assets folder. The item box sizes should be the same as the worn items in the home screen. The two item boxes should be displayed in a grid with a maximum of three columns. Since in this case there are only two items, the grid should only have 2 columns. The grid should be horizontally centered. Below the suggested clothing items are two blue buttons stacked on top of one another. The top button is labeled "Wear" and the bottom button is labeled "Swap item". Make sure to include the same gradient background in this screen as in the home screen and also include the same navigation menu at the bottom. Make sure the navigation menu works properly such that the user can click on home to return to the home screen from the suggestion screen. Do not implement any of the other navigation features.
